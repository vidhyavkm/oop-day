OOP => object oriented programming
OOPs:
4 features:
objects, classes, encapsulation, inheritance 

the most popular model OOP model is a class-based.
the object variable (names) has only two properties=> fname, lname
this property come from object prototype.

but javascript is a prototype object based language.
object has always its keys and values.

so javascript cannot use the class directly
to make JS a classbased object we can use 2 ways:

1. object literal
2. object constructor

class is always have a constructor and a function. 
this constructor holds the parameters .
and also this constructor has all variables inside it .

this :this is an object in javascript
it is primarily used to point to an instance of an object from constructor.

keywords: constructor, new , this 

classes:
 it is like a blueprint of an object 
 object is an instance 
we say classes as a templates

syntax: classname{
    constructor(){

    }
}

when u want to access n number of data then go for class constructor method
